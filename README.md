# aspnetcoreMVC

This is an example of creating a web application in asp.net core 2.1 using MVC to insert data.

When creating a web application project with a template, folders and files are already created to use.

I have posted the files that I mainly worked with.

The model class Customer.cs is used to interact with the database.

The class CustomerContext.cs uses Entity Framework for the database and tables.

The class CustomerController.cs is a controller used for the view to interact with the model.

The view file Insert.cshtml contains the html code for a form to insert data with the button control.





Some of the other files that were modified include startup.cs for configuration.

The appsettings.json were modified for the db connection.
